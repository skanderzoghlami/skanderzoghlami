### Welcome to my github page ! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer from Tunisia currently residing in Toulouse, France.

My main areas of interest mostly focus on Computer Vision and 3D Technology, including Rendering, Animations, Geometric Modeling, and Computational Geometry. I also had the chance to work on several AI-driven projects.

If you have any questions or if you want to collaborate on a project feel free to contact me on my LinkedIn account.

### [BeamTracer](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/BeamTracer)

This is a Ray Tracer written from scratch by following the RayTracing in 1 weekend book (kinda slow for the moment but I have some ideas to implement in future versions)

### [OpenGl Rendering Library](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/Rendering-with-opengl)

This is a rendering library that I created while following the [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/) tutorials and the victor gordan youtube series, it allows the user to render 3D models write Shaders, Postprocess with framebuffer, Anti-aliasing, shadow maps instancing and much more.

### [School Project: 3D Rendering](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/OpenGL-Scene-Rendering-using-Gkit2light)

This is a school project where I used the Gkit2light library (a rendering library) to render images using OpenGL. Tasks included rendering textures, Frustum Culling, and Shadow Mapping using the Z-buffer.

### [School Project: Bezier Surfaces Manipulation](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/QT-Project-Surfaces-Beziers-Revolutions-Deformations)

In this school project, I used the Tinymesh library (which implements the Marching Cubes algorithm) to create Meshes from Control Points defining a Bézier surface, then applied 3D transformations to manipulate the shape.

### [School Project: Surface Distance Fields Mesh Generation](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/QT-Project-Surfaces-Implicites-Marching-Cube-Sphere-Tracing)

Here, I used Tinymesh to generate meshes by combining primitives defined via equations, combining them using union, intersection, and difference operations.

### [Online Video Editor](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/Video-Editor-on-Google-Colab)

A Colab-based video editor that downloads media, combines them, and uploads the result to YouTube. Designed to bypass poor internet speeds during my time in Tunisia.
