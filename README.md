### Welcome to my github page ! 👋


I'm a Software Engineer from tunisia currently residing in Toulouse, France.

My main areas of interest mostly focus on Computer Vision and 3D Technology, including Rendering, Animations, Geometric Modeling, and Computational Geometry I also had the chance to work on several AI-driven projects.

If you have any questions or if you want to colaborate on a project feel free to contact me on my linkedin account.

### [BeamTracer](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/BeamTracer)

This is a Ray Tracer written from scratch by following the RayTracing in 1 weekend book (kinda slow for the moment but I have some ideas to implement in future versions)

### [OpenGl Rendering Library](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/Rendering-with-opengl)

This is a rendering library that I created while following the [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/) tutorials, I didn't finish it all I only stopped at Advanced lighting chapter with the Shadow Mapping, but the project can still be used to render meshes and experiment with Shaders.

### [School Project: 3D Rendering](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/OpenGL-Scene-Rendering-using-Gkit2light)

This is a school project I used the Gkit2light library (which is a rendering library) to render images using opengl, some of the tasks I implemented is rendering textures, Frustum Culling and Shadow mapping using the Z-buffer.

### [School Project: Bezier Surfaces Manipulation](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/QT-Project-Surfaces-Beziers-Revolutions-Deformations)

In This school project I used the school library called Tinymesh (which implements the Marching cube algorithm) to creates Meshes using Control points that define a bezier surface, I then apply 3D transformations on the control points to manipulate the Mesh and make weird shapes 👽👽.

### [School Project: Surface Distance Fields Mesh Generation](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/QT-Project-Surfaces-Implicites-Marching-Cube-Sphere-Tracing)

In This school project I used the school library called Tinymesh (which implements the Marching cube algorithm) to creates Meshes by combining primitives, the primitives are defined using their corresponding mathemtical equations and they were combined using Math operations like Union Intersection and differences.

### [Online Video Editor](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/Video-Editor-on-Google-Colab)

I did this project when I was living in Tunisia and the internet was awful especially in upload, the idea is to use google colab to download videos/audios combine them and create a video with them and then automatically upload it to youtube using Colab's VM environmet, that allowed me to make 3+ hours videos and upload them to youtube in a matter of minutes 😏)

My notes for the Advanced computing with Cuda Nvidia Course


## 🎃🎃 Useful stuff 🎃🎃
### [DALLE Discord Bot](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/Dalle-Discord-bot)

This is a discord bot that uses the Dalle API and can be integrated to discord servers to create images from prompts

### [ChatGPT Discord Bot](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/ChatGPT-Discord-Bot)

This is a discord bot that uses the OpenAI API and can be integrated to discord servers to answer questions

### [Fast Marching](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/Fast-Marching-Implementation)

An implementation of the Fast Marching Algorithm to generate distance maps for a given image

### [Internetwork Sender](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/Internetwork-sender)

A small python script to send files from 1 computer to the other in the same network (Yep I did this because I couldn't find my SSD 🤣)

### [Optimal Transform for style Transfer](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/Optimal-Transform)

In this project I apply the optimal transform between the two images to transfer the style of one of them into the other.

### [Point Cloud Patch Generation](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/Data-Structure-to-store-Meshes)

A colab notebook that shows how to devide a given point cloud into a set of patches of equal size!;

### [Mesh Data Structure](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/Data-Structure-to-store-Meshes)
Just a C++ class to store a mesh and prepare it for further computational geometry operations.

### [Home Searcher](https://github.com/skanderzoghlami/home_search)

A python script to continiously send API get requests to a server and notify the user when a room is available (Yep I used this to find a dorm room when I was homeless in French streets 💀💀)
